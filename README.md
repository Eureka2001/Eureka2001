### Hi, 👋I'm Erueka Wang
-----
- 🌱 I’m a graduate student learning CS.
- "Eureka!" or "Ευρηκα!" means "I find it!" I want to be an explorer to search for what I am interested in.
- My avatar is from the anime [Nichijou](https://anilist.co/anime/10165/)("日常" in Chinese, "Ordinary Life" in English). It is from episode 11 around the 16 minute and 8-second mark, and it can also be found through [this link](https://nichijou.fandom.com/wiki/Interstitials).
